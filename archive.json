We report results for two approaches: the first fine-tunes a pre-trained language model (PLM) on the shared task data, and the second uses few-shot in-context learning (ICL) with a large language model (LLM). Both achieve high performance as measured by automatic metrics (e.g. ROUGE, BERTScore) and ranked second and first, respectively, of all submissions to the shared task. Expert human scrutiny indicates that notes generated via the ICL-based approach with GPT-4 are preferred about as often as human-written notes, making it a promising path toward automated note generation from doctor-patient conversations.", "keywords": ""}, {"title": "A Sequence-To-Sequence Approach For Document-Level Relation Extraction", "authors": "John Giorgi, Gary Bader, Bo Wang", "year": "2022", "ref_id": "giorgi-etal-2022-sequence", "link": "https://aclanthology.org/2022.bionlp-1.2", "abstract": "", "keywords": ""}, {"title": "Large Language Models Are Fixated By Red Herrings: Exploring Creative Problem Solving And Einstellung Effect Using The Only Connect Wall Dataset", "authors": "Saeid Alavi Naeini, Raeid Saqur, Mozhgan Saeidi, John Giorgi, Babak Taati", "year": "2023", "ref_id": "Naeini2023LargeLM", "link": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:259203717", "abstract": "", "keywords": ""}]
